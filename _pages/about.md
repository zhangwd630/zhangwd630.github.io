Hi, I'm **Weidong Zhang**.

I recently graduated with a **Master of Science in Data Analytics Engineering** from **Northeastern University Vancouver campus**. 
My research and professional interests include:

- Data analytics and machine learning  
- Natural language processing and social computing  
- Medical imaging and AI for healthcare  

Some of the projects I have worked on:

- **Reddit discussion analysis** focusing on intellectual humility and online behavior in different communities  
- Course projects involving optimization models, database systems, and data visualization in Python, R, SQL, and Tableau  

I enjoy exploring how data, algorithms, and human behavior interact in real-world systems.  
Outside of research and study, I like trying new food, traveling, and learning new tools that make my work more efficient.
